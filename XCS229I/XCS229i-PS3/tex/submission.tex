% If assignment with subquestion (1.a) requires a written response, you will
% find the following flag within this document: <SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>_1a
% In this example, you would insert the LaTeX for your solution to (1.a) between
% the <SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>_1a flags.  If you also constrain your answer between the
% START_CODE_HERE and END_CODE_HERE flags, your LaTeX will be styled as a
% solution within the final document.

% Please do not use the '<SCPD_SUBMISSION_TAG>' character anywhere within your code.  As expected,
% that will confuse the regular expressions we use to identify your solution.

  % ### START CODE HERE ###
  As given in the problem set any kernel to be necessarily a kernel it should be symmetric and positive semidefinte.\\ 
  For $K(x,z) = K_1(x,z) + K_2(x,z) $ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that $K_1$ and $K_2$ are valid kernels. \\
  The kernel matrix corresponding to $K(x,z) $ is sum of two valid kernel matrices $K_1$ and $K_2$. \\ \\ 
  So $K(x,z)$ is Symmetric\\
  
  PSD: \\
  $z^TKz$ \\
  $ = z^T(K_1+K_2)z$ \\
  $ = z^TK_1z + z^TK_2z$ \\
  $\geq 0$  Note that, $ z^TK_1z \geq 0$ and $z^TK_2z \geq 0$ as they are valid kernels \\ \\
  
 Since  $K(x,z) = K_1(x,z) + K_2(x,z) $ is Symmetric and PSD it is necessarily a kernel

  For $K(x,z) = K_1(x,z) - K_2(x,z) $ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that $K_1$ and $K_2$ are valid kernels. \\
  The kernel matrix corresponding to $K(x,z) $ is difference of two valid kernel matrices $K_1$ and $K_2$. \\ \\ 
  So $K(x,z)$ is Symmetric\\
  
  PSD: \\
  $z^TKz$ \\
  $ = z^T(K_1-K_2)z$ \\
  $ = z^TK_1z - z^TK_2z$ \\
  $\geq 0$  This is true only for cases when $ z^TK_1z > z^TK_2z$ \\ \\
  
 Since  $K(x,z) = K_1(x,z) - K_2(x,z) $ is Symmetric but not PSD it is not necessarily a kernel

  For $K(x,z) =K_1(x,z)K_2(x,z) $ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that $K_1$ and $K_2$ are valid kernels. \\
  So $K(x,z)$ is Symmetric because of commutative property\\
  
  PSD: \\
  $K(x,z) =K_1(x,z)K_2(x,z) $ \\
  $K(x,z) = \displaystyle \sum_i \phi_{i}^{(1)}(x) \phi_{i}^{(1)}(z) \displaystyle \sum_j \phi_{j}^{(2)}(x) \phi_{j}^{(2)}(z) $\\
  $K(x,z) = \displaystyle \sum_i  \displaystyle \sum_j \phi_{i}^{(1)}(x) \phi_{i}^{(1)}(z) \phi_{j}^{(2)}(x) \phi_{j}^{(2)}(z) $\\
  $K(x,z) = \displaystyle \sum_i  \displaystyle \sum_j [\phi_{i}^{(1)}(x) \phi_{j}^{(2)}(x)] [\phi_{i}^{(1)}(z) \phi_{j}^{(2)}(z)] $\\ \\
 def $\psi(.) =  \phi^{(1)}(.) \phi^{(2)}(.)$ \\  So we have \\
 
 $K(x,z) = \displaystyle \sum_i  \displaystyle \sum_j \psi_{i,j}(x) \psi_{i,j}(z) $\\ \\
 $K(x,z) = \psi(x)^{T} \psi(z) $\\ \\
 Now lets replace \\
 $z^TKz $\\ $=  z^t \psi(x)^{T} \psi(z)z$ \\
 $ =  \geq 0 $ so a PSD \\
 Since  $K(x,z) =K_1(x,z)K_2(x,z) $ is Symmetric and PSD it is necessarily a kernel.

  For $K(x,z) =f(x)f(z) $ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that f is real valued function \\ 
  So $K(x,z)$ is Symmetric because scalar multiplication is commutiative \\
  
  PSD: \\
  Let f(x) = $ \psi (x)$ as in 1.e \\
  So $K(x,z) =f(x)f(z)$ is PSD as per 1.e  \\

  Since $K(x,z) =f(x)f(z) $ is Symmetric and PSD it is necessarily a kernel.

  For $K(x,z) =K_3(\phi(x), \phi(z))$ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that $K_3$ is a Kernel \\
  So $K(x,z)$ is Symmetric because by definition of $K_3$ \\
  
  PSD: \\
  $z^TKz $\\ = $z^TK_3z $ \\
  $ =  \geq 0 $ so a PSD

  Since $K(x,z) =K3(\phi(x), \phi(z))$ is Symmetric and PSD it is necessarily a kernel. \\
  Also $K_3$ is valid kernel for any finite set $\{x^{(1)},...,x^{(n)}\}$ This also includes  $\{\phi(x^{(1)}),...,\phi(x^{(n)})\}$ so K is necessarily a kernel. \\

    As given in the problem set any kernel to be necessarily a kernel it should be symmetric and positive semidefinte.\\
  For $K(x,z) =p(K1(x,z))$ \\ \\
  Lets evalute symmetric nature for K: \\
  It is given in the problem set that p is a polynomial over x with postive coefficients \\
  Let p(x) = $ \sum_i a_ix^i $ \\
  So if we expand for $p(K1)$ we will get terms from 1.a, 1.c, 1.e 1.f which are all symmetric \\
  So $K(x,z)$ is symmetric \\
  
  PSD: \\
  $z^TKz$ \\
  = $z^T(\sum_i a_iK_1^i)z $ \\
  = $\sum_i a_iz^TK_1^i z $ \\
  Here $a_i$ are postive coefficients and from 1.e we can conclude that  $\sum_i a_iz^TK_1^i z $  will be $  \geq 0 $ \\ 
  Hence a PSD \\ 
  Since $K(x,z) =p(K1(x,z))$ is Symmetric and PSD it is necessarily a kernel. \\
  So any polynomial of kernel $K_1$ will also be a kernel
