% STUMP_BOOSTER Uses boosted decision stumps to train a classifier
%
% [theta, feature_inds, thresholds] = stump_booster(X, y, T)
%  performs T rounds of boosted decision stumps to classify the data X,
%  which is an m-by-n matrix of m training examples in dimension n,
%  to match y.
%
%  The returned parameters are theta, the parameter vector in T dimensions,
%  the feature_inds, which are indices of the features (a T dimensional
%  vector taking values in {1, 2, ..., n}), and thresholds, which are
%  real-valued thresholds. The resulting classifier may be computed on an
%  n-dimensional training example by
%
%   theta' * sign(x(feature_inds) - thresholds).
%
%  The resulting predictions may be computed simultaneously on an
%  n-dimensional dataset, represented as an m-by-n matrix X, by
%
%  sign(X(:, feature_inds) - repmat(thresholds', m, 1)) * theta.
%
%  This is an m-vector of the predicted margins.
